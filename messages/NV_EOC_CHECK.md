For the state of {{Policy.PolicyState}}, the member's EOC should be checked to verify if appeals need to be submitted in writing.

If the appeal or grievance is in reference to a **denial of prior authorizations to visit an out of network provider**, it must be submitted in writing.

However, any complaint or grievance which is not an appeal can be taken verbally over the phone.
